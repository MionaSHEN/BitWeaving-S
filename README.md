# BitWeaving-S  
## Overview
A simple implementation of BitWeaving, a technique that exploits the parallelism available at the bit level in modern processors. BitWeaving operates on multiple bits of data in a single cycle, processing bits from different columns in each cycle. For more details, please refer to [the BitWeaving Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2463676.2465322).    
## Usage
Just compile and run.
'''
make
./BitWeaving
'''
## Detail of the codes
### Basic information
In this program VBP (Algorithm 2 in [the BitWeaving Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2463676.2465322)) is implemented. You can set the number of rows of data in the database, as well as the length of the data (number of bits used to represent a row of data). The length of each word is fixed to 32.
### About SIMD
SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) are used to speed up the program. A 128-bit register is devided into 4 32-bit parts (an int in C/C++). So 4 sections in the VBP algorithm can ran in parallel.
